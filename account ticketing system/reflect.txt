2. One of the two components I enjoyed creating was about listing new, active, and closed tickets. 
Although I did not have to write lines of codes to achieve it, these components are quite functional 
because the functions I created before were helpful. Therefore, It was fun to create a functional 
thing without dealing with complex problems. I also learned how to break a big function into small 
functions. Breaking a big function into smaller ones enables me to organize my code. Thus the design 
of my code became better. Before those components, my code was hard to read and if I make any mistakes, 
it was hard to fix them. The other component I enjoyed creating was updating person, account, and login 
information. Before I worked on this component, I was having problems with how to use pointers. When I 
was creating this component, I had a chance to reinforce my knowledge about the pointers because this 
component force me to use pointers frequently. Although I had some trouble at the beginning of this 
component, I started to have fun after learning more about how to use pointers correctly. Now, I am 
feeling that I have concrete knowledge about pointers. Therefore it was fun to work on this.

3. One of the two components I do not like creating was when we remove an account. In the beginning, I 
thought it would be easy to do. However, when I started working on this component, I had trouble with 
removing account tickets. I could not figure out how to remove tickets, and therefore I tried different 
ways. Although I eventually created it correctly, I had to spend a lot of time on it. Thus, it was not 
fun to work on this part of the project. Another component that I did not like working on was creating 
the getCString function. Although this function was helpful in every part of the project, I had to spend 
so much time getting it done correctly. Since we were not allowed to use string libraries, initially, I 
had trouble with finding the length of the string. It was also hard for me to find the correct place for 
the clearStandardInputBuffer function. Additionally, the minimum and the maximum length requirements made 
it even harder. Even though I learned many things when I was creating this, I spent a lot of time, and when 
I was stuck at certain places, I felt overwhelmed. Thus it was not so likable to work on it.
